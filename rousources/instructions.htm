	<h1>How To Play Memory Game</h1>
	<p>You have unlimited attempts to find matches in the panels.</p>
	<p>On each turn, a player flips over two cards.</p>
	<p>You can use your mouse to pick and choose which tiles you want to match. 
		If the two cards match, they remain face up, and you continue choosing tiles to match. 
		If the two cards do not match, they will be visible to 2 second and then, 
		they are flipped back over face down.
		Pressing the Esc key will close the Leaderboard dialog and the Memory game.</p>
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<p>This is how the board will look overall.</p>

	<p>This is how it'll look when a match is found.</p>
	<img alt="" src="match_found.png">
	<p>This is the pop-up that'll happen when a tile is 
		selected when it's already visible.</p>
	<img alt="" src="wrong_selection.png">
	<p>Choose a different tile that's not already visible.</p>
	<p> Tiles chosen that do not match will flip back over after two second.
	</p>
	<p> After all the matching pairs have been found, then the game ends!
	<p>Good luck!</p>
